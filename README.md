## ✨ What is GiftDrop?

GiftDrop solves a real problem — when a group of friends wants to pool money for a surprise
gift, someone always has to be trusted with the funds and manually collect from everyone.
GiftDrop eliminates this by locking funds in a Soroban smart contract that automatically
releases on the reveal date, or refunds everyone if the target isn't met.

## 🎯 Real-world Use Cases
- Birthday surprise gifts
- Farewell gifts for colleagues
- Festival group gifting
- Office celebration pools

## ✨ Features
- **Create a Gift Drop** — Set target amount, recipient wallet, deadline and reveal date
- **Secret Contributions** — Friends lock XLM silently into smart contract
- **Hidden from Recipient** — Recipient can't see amount or contributors until reveal date
- **Auto Release** — Full amount releases to recipient on reveal date
- **Auto Refund** — Everyone gets refunded if target isn't met by deadline
- **No Trust Needed** — Smart contract handles everything, no manual collection
- **Explorer Links** — Every transaction visible on Stellar Expert
